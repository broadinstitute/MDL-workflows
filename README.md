# MDL-workflows

This repo houses the production as well as test/dev workflows for the Methods Development Lab at GP. It is mainly set-up to facilitate integration of frequently used utilities with Dockstore and Terra. 

**Please note this is a public repository and code should be sanitized and stripped of sensitive data before being committed.**

Dockstore integration enables automatic syncing of registered and published workflows once they are added to .dockstore.yml file here. If these chnages are launched with Terra through Dockstore, changes pushed to a branch in repo would be reflected within the associated Terra workspace simultaneously. 

pre-commit-ci (https://pre-commit.ci/) was enabled at start up.
